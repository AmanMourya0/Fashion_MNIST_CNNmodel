# Fashion MNIST Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on the Fashion MNIST dataset. Fashion MNIST is a dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28 pixels, belonging to 10 different fashion categories. The goal is to classify these images into their respective categories using deep learning techniques.

## Dataset
Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. The classes are as follows:

0 T-shirt/top
1 Trouser
2 Pullover
3 Dress
4 Coat
5 Sandal
6 Shirt
7 Sneaker
8 Bag
9 Ankle boot
## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture used in this repository consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction, and fully connected layers for classification. The architecture details can be found in the source code.
